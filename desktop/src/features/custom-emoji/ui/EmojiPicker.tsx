/**
 * The one emoji picker for the whole app. Every place that lets a user choose
 * an emoji — composing a message, reacting to a regular or system message,
 * setting a status — renders this, so the config and custom-emoji wiring can't
 * drift across call sites (they used to, and that's why custom emoji were
 * missing from some pickers).
 *
 * It always wires the workspace custom-emoji palette in via `useCustomEmoji()`,
 * so custom emoji show up everywhere for free. Selection is normalized to a
 * single string: a standard emoji emits its `native` glyph; a custom emoji has
 * no `native`, so it emits its `:shortcode:` (the emoji-mart `id` is the
 * shortcode). Consumers store/send that string and let the existing renderers
 * (reactions' `emojiUrl`, the remark shortcode plugin) resolve it to an image.
 *
 * Only the raw picker lives here — not the Popover/trigger. Those differ per
 * site (ghost button vs status swatch, popover vs dialog content) and forcing
 * them into one wrapper would be less clear, not more. The thing that drifted
 * was the picker config + custom wiring + select handling; that's what this
 * centralizes.
