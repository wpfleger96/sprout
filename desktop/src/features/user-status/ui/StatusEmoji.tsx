/**
 * Render a user-status emoji from its stored string. A status emoji is a bare
 * string (unlike reactions, which carry a companion `emojiUrl`): a native glyph
 * like `💬`, or a custom-emoji `:shortcode:`. This resolves a known shortcode to
 * its workspace image and renders it as an `<img>`; anything else (native glyph,
 * or an unknown `:foo:`) renders as text.
 *
 * Every place that shows a status emoji renders this, so the shortcode→image
 * resolution can't drift across the (five) display sites — the same reason the
 * picker is unified. The relay URL is rewritten through the localhost media
 * proxy, matching reactions' `EmojiGlyph` (WKWebView bypasses WARP, so a direct
 * relay URL 403s and renders broken).
